<current_state>
Milestone v0.5 is initialized and ready for execution planning. ROADMAP, REQUIREMENTS, PROJECT, and STATE were updated and committed. No Phase 30 PLAN.md exists yet; next actionable step is `/gsd-discuss-phase 30` (or `/gsd-plan-phase 30`).
</current_state>

<completed_work>

- Milestone kickoff completed and committed (`e9ac83f032`): PROJECT.md + STATE.md moved to v0.5 context.
- Research completed and committed (`cc51749d6f`): STACK, FEATURES, ARCHITECTURE, PITFALLS, SUMMARY under `.planning/research/`.
- v0.5 REQUIREMENTS.md created and committed (`f5029170da`): 12 scoped requirements with IDs.
- v0.5 roadmap created and committed (`98d10697aa`): Phases 30-33 with 100% requirement traceability.
- Tag `v0.4` already pushed to origin in prior step.
</completed_work>

<remaining_work>

- Task 1: Discuss Phase 30 scope decisions and lock implementation choices.
- Task 2: Create Phase 30 plan(s) (`/gsd-plan-phase 30`).
- Task 3: Execute Phase 30 plan(s) (`/gsd-execute-phase 30`).
- Task 4: Verify Phase 30 and update phase/milestone state documents.
</remaining_work>

<decisions_made>

- v0.5 focus is advanced learning + language support, not platform rewrite; deterministic-first review path remains primary.
- Learning and retrieval must be additive + fail-open (never block review publication).
- Repo-scoped learning isolation is the default; any cross-repo behavior must be explicit opt-in.
- Canonical severity/category taxonomy must remain stable even with localized multi-language output.
- Phase ordering for v0.5 is fixed to reduce regression risk: 30 foundation -> 31 incremental/retrieval -> 32 language -> 33 explainability.
</decisions_made>

<blockers>
- No active blockers for starting Phase 30 planning.
- Note: there are unrelated, pre-existing dirty/untracked planning files in phases 27-29 and `.planning/debug/`; do not include/revert unless explicitly requested.
</blockers>

<context>
Current vibe: milestone is cleanly initialized and ready to move from strategic docs into execution. The immediate priority is to lock Phase 30 contracts around immutable SHA identity, repo isolation, and embedding memory schema before enabling any adaptive behavior. Keep reliability-first posture: preserve existing publish flow and make new memory/retrieval paths bounded and fail-open.

<next_action>
Start with: `/gsd-discuss-phase 30` to capture locked decisions for state/memory/isolation contracts, then run `/gsd-plan-phase 30`.

<objective>
Produce the final Phase 75 closure evidence run where all OPS75 families pass together and verification status can move from `gaps_found` to `passed`.

Purpose: Phase 75 remains blocked until cache-lane and exactly-once degraded checks pass in one reproducible live run with strict check-ID proof.
Output: Updated smoke evidence and verification report showing complete OPS75 closure with explicit release-blocking discipline preserved.

  <name>Task 1: Execute OPS75 verifier with the preflight-valid identity matrix and capture one passing evidence bundle</name>
  <files>docs/smoke/phase75-live-ops-verification-closure.md</files>
  <action>
Run a single deterministic verifier execution using the Task 75-05 identity bundle:

- Execute `bun run verify:phase75` with explicit `--review`, `--review-accepted`, `--mention`, and `--degraded` identities from the same matrix run.
- Capture full output, including check lines and final verdict, without paraphrasing check IDs.
- Confirm `OPS75-CACHE-01`, `OPS75-CACHE-02`, `OPS75-ONCE-01`, `OPS75-ONCE-02`, `OPS75-FAILOPEN-01`, and `OPS75-FAILOPEN-02` all PASS in the same run.
- If any check fails, record blocker state with exact failing IDs and stop; do not claim closure.
  </action>
  <verify>
Run `bun run verify:phase75 ...` and validate that all required OPS75 checks pass with `Final verdict: PASS`.
  </verify>
  <done>
Smoke evidence contains one reproducible, machine-checkable OPS75 pass bundle proving cache coverage, exactly-once degraded telemetry, and fail-open behavior.
  </done>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Update Phase 75 verification report to reflect closed gaps with evidence-linked check IDs</name>
  <files>.planning/phases/75-live-ops-verification-closure/75-VERIFICATION.md</files>
  <action>
Re-run phase verification and update the verification report based on Task 1 evidence:

- Mark previously failed truths as verified only if the same smoke run proves all required check families PASS.
- Cite exact evidence references and check IDs for OPS75-CACHE-01/02 and OPS75-ONCE-01/02 closures.
- Keep release-blocking language explicit: any future non-passing rerun reopens the gap.
- Ensure report status and score reflect closed-gaps outcome.
  </action>
  <verify>
Confirm updated `75-VERIFICATION.md` reports passing status and references the same smoke evidence run that produced passing OPS75 check IDs.
  </verify>
  <done>
Phase 75 verification report records a reproducible closure outcome tied directly to one passing OPS75 evidence bundle.
  </done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
- `bun run verify:phase75 ...` returns `Final verdict: PASS` with all required OPS75 check IDs passing in one run.
- `docs/smoke/phase75-live-ops-verification-closure.md` records the exact command, identities, and check output.
- `.planning/phases/75-live-ops-verification-closure/75-VERIFICATION.md` reflects closed gaps with evidence-linked references.
</verification>

<success_criteria>
Phase 75 has closure-grade live evidence: both cache lanes and degraded exactly-once checks pass in the same deterministic run, fail-open checks remain passing, and verification status moves to passed.
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/75-live-ops-verification-closure/75-06-SUMMARY.md`

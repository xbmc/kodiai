<objective>
Make issue write success output machine-checkable so producer status semantics are contract-parity with failure-path replies.

Purpose: Phase 74 locked failure-path machine-checkability, but success replies still rely on free-form text (`Opened PR`) that can drift and break downstream automation.
Output: Updated mention-handler success reply envelope with deterministic markers plus regression coverage proving success-path status contracts stay parseable.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Emit deterministic success status envelope in issue write publish replies</name>
  <files>src/handlers/mention.ts</files>
  <action>
Update the issue write-mode success publish branch to emit a machine-checkable envelope that mirrors failure-path status semantics:

- Add a dedicated success reply builder (parallel to `buildIssueWriteFailureReply`) that emits deterministic `key: value` lines including at minimum `status: success`, `pr_url`, and `issue_linkback_url` alongside the existing human-readable PR line.
- Keep failure behavior unchanged (`status: pr_creation_failed`, `failed_step`, `diagnostics`) so producer output now supports both status paths with parseable markers.
- Ensure success reply is emitted only after the existing artifact triad is complete (branch push result present, PR URL present, issue linkback post succeeded).
- Do not introduce prose-only success wording as the sole success signal; status markers must remain first-class contract data.
  </action>
  <verify>
Run `bun test ./src/handlers/mention.test.ts --timeout 30000`.
Run `bunx tsc --noEmit`.
  </verify>
  <done>
Issue write success replies include deterministic status markers and PR/linkback details that can be parsed without relying on free-form text.
  </done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Lock success-path status envelope behavior with regression assertions</name>
  <files>src/handlers/mention.test.ts</files>
  <action>
Extend issue write-mode tests to enforce producer contract parity:

- Update existing success-path issue write tests (explicit and implicit write intent) to assert `status: success` and required success markers (`pr_url`, `issue_linkback_url`) in reply bodies.
- Keep existing failure assertions (`status: pr_creation_failed`, `failed_step`) to ensure dual-path contract parity remains intact.
- Add at least one negative regression assertion proving success replies are not considered valid when machine-checkable markers are missing.
- Preserve current no-false-success expectations for failure outcomes (`Opened PR:` must not appear on failure).
  </action>
  <verify>
Run `bun test ./src/handlers/mention.test.ts --timeout 30000` and confirm success + failure contract tests pass.
  </verify>
  <done>
Regression suite fails if success-path status markers drift or disappear, preventing non-machine-checkable success replies from shipping.
  </done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
- `src/handlers/mention.ts` success reply includes deterministic `status: success` markers plus PR/linkback fields.
- `src/handlers/mention.test.ts` asserts both success and failure status envelopes using machine-checkable markers.
- `bun test ./src/handlers/mention.test.ts --timeout 30000` and `bunx tsc --noEmit` pass.

<success_criteria>
Producer contract parity is restored: issue write success replies are machine-checkable with deterministic status markers and are regression-locked alongside existing failure-path semantics.

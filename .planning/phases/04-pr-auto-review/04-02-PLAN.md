<objective>
Create the review handler that registers for PR events, orchestrates the full review pipeline (clone, fetch base branch, build prompt, execute, silent approve), and wire it into the server.

Purpose: This is the core of Phase 4 -- the handler that connects webhook events to the execution engine with review-specific logic. It handles fork PRs, draft PR filtering, author skipping, config-driven enable/disable, and the post-execution silent approval flow.

Output: `src/handlers/review.ts` (new), updated `src/index.ts`, updated `src/execution/types.ts` and `src/execution/executor.ts`

  <name>Task 1: Create review handler with fork support and silent approval</name>
  <files>src/handlers/review.ts, src/execution/types.ts, src/execution/executor.ts</files>
  <action>
**Step 1: Add promptOverride to ExecutionContext**

In `src/execution/types.ts`, add an optional `promptOverride?: string` field to the `ExecutionContext` interface. This allows the review handler to pass the review-specific prompt directly, bypassing the generic `buildPrompt()`.

**Step 2: Update executor to use promptOverride**

In `src/execution/executor.ts`, find where `buildPrompt(context)` is called and change it to:
```typescript
const prompt = context.promptOverride ?? buildPrompt(context);
```

This is a one-line change. Do not modify any other executor behavior.

**Step 3: Create the review handler**

Create `src/handlers/review.ts` with a `createReviewHandler()` factory function following the established pattern (see 01-01 decision: factory function pattern for all module exports).

**Dependencies (constructor injection):**
```typescript
export function createReviewHandler(deps: {
  eventRouter: EventRouter;
  jobQueue: JobQueue;
  workspaceManager: WorkspaceManager;
  githubApp: GitHubApp;
  executor: ReturnType<typeof createExecutor>;
  logger: Logger;
}): void
```

The function registers two event handlers and returns void (side effect: registers with eventRouter).

**Core flow for `handleReview(event)`:**

1. **Extract PR data** from `event.payload` cast as `PullRequestOpenedEvent | PullRequestReadyForReviewEvent` (import from `@octokit/webhooks-types`). Use a helper function `extractPRData(payload)` that returns:
   - `number`, `title`, `body`, `author`, `draft`, `baseBranch`, `headBranch`, `headSha`
   - `isFork` (true when `pr.head.repo?.full_name !== payload.repository.full_name`)
   - `cloneOwner`, `cloneRepo` (from `pr.head.repo` with fallback to `payload.repository`)
   - `apiOwner`, `apiRepo` (always from `payload.repository`)
   - `changedFiles` -- NOT available from webhook payload, will be empty array (Claude discovers via git diff)

2. **Skip draft PRs:** If `pr.draft === true`, log debug and return early.

3. **Enqueue job** via `jobQueue.enqueue(event.installationId, async () => { ... })`:

   a. **Create workspace:** Call `workspaceManager.create(event.installationId, { owner: cloneOwner, repo: cloneRepo, ref: headBranch, depth: 50 })`. Use depth 50 (not 1) so git diff has enough history. For fork PRs from public repos, the workspace manager already handles clone via HTTPS with token -- if the fork is public, the clone URL will still work with the base repo's installation token against the fork (GitHub allows this for public repos).

   b. **Fetch base branch:** After workspace creation, run `Bun.$\`git -C ${workspace.dir} fetch origin ${baseBranch} --depth=1\`.quiet()` to fetch the base branch tip for diff comparison. Wrap in try/catch -- if this fails (e.g., deleted fork), log error and return early (cleanup workspace in finally).

   c. **Load repo config:** Call `loadRepoConfig(workspace.dir)` to get the `.kodiai.yml` settings.

   d. **Check review.enabled:** If `config.review.enabled === false`, log info "Review disabled by config" and return early.

   e. **Check review.skipAuthors:** If `config.review.skipAuthors.includes(prData.author)`, log info and return early. This allows skipping dependabot, renovate, etc.

   f. **Build review prompt:** Call `buildReviewPrompt({ owner: apiOwner, repo: apiRepo, prNumber: number, prTitle: title, prBody: body ?? "", prAuthor: author, baseBranch, headBranch, changedFiles: [], customInstructions: config.review.prompt })`. Pass empty changedFiles array -- Claude will discover changed files via git log/diff commands.

   g. **Execute:** Call `executor.execute({ workspace, installationId: event.installationId, owner: apiOwner, repo: apiRepo, prNumber: number, commentId: undefined, eventType: \`pull_request.${payload.action}\`, triggerBody: "", promptOverride: prompt })`. Pass the review prompt via the new `promptOverride` field so the executor uses it directly instead of calling `buildPrompt()`.

   h. **Post-execution silent approval:** After `executor.execute()` returns, if `result.conclusion === "success"`, call `maybeApprove()`.

   i. **Workspace cleanup:** Always in `finally` block via `workspace.cleanup()`.

4. **Register handlers:**
   ```typescript
   eventRouter.register("pull_request.opened", handleReview);
   eventRouter.register("pull_request.ready_for_review", handleReview);
   ```

**`maybeApprove` helper** (private function in the module):
- Get `octokit` via `githubApp.getInstallationOctokit(installationId)`
- List recent review comments: `octokit.rest.pulls.listReviewComments({ owner, repo, pull_number: prNumber, sort: "created", direction: "desc", per_page: 100 })` -- use per_page 100 (not 10) to avoid missing bot comments when many inline comments are posted
- Get app slug via `githubApp.getAppSlug()`
- Filter comments where `c.user?.login === \`${appSlug}[bot]\``
- If NO bot comments found, submit `createReview({ owner, repo, pull_number: prNumber, event: "APPROVE" })` with no body. This is the "silent approval" -- an APPROVE review with no comment text.
- If bot comments exist, skip the approval (Claude already posted its findings).
- Wrap in try/catch to avoid crashing if approval fails (e.g., PR was closed between review and approval).

**Fork PR handling (Pitfall 2 from research):**
- For fork PRs, `pr.head.repo` might be null (deleted fork). If `pr.head.repo === null`, log a warning "Skipping review: fork repository has been deleted (head.repo is null)" and return early without attempting to clone. This is an edge case that occurs when a contributor deletes their fork after opening a PR. The user can re-trigger via @mention if needed. Fall back to cloning from the base repo is NOT attempted because the head branch ref may not exist in the base repo.

**Error handling:**
- All errors within the job are caught and logged (the executor already never throws, but workspace creation and git fetch might). The handler should catch these and log, not crash the server.
  </action>
  <verify>Run `bun build src/handlers/review.ts --no-bundle` to verify it compiles. Check that `src/execution/types.ts` has the `promptOverride` field. Check that `src/execution/executor.ts` uses `promptOverride` when present.</verify>
  <done>
- `createReviewHandler()` registers for `pull_request.opened` and `pull_request.ready_for_review`
- Draft PRs are skipped
- Fork PRs clone from head.repo; null head.repo PRs are skipped with warning (deleted fork edge case documented)
- Base branch is fetched after clone for diff context
- Config-driven review.enabled and review.skipAuthors are respected
- Review prompt is passed via promptOverride on ExecutionContext
- After successful execution, maybeApprove submits APPROVE review if no bot comments found (checks up to 100 comments)
- ExecutionContext.promptOverride field added to types.ts
- Executor checks for promptOverride before calling buildPrompt

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Wire review handler into server startup</name>
  <files>src/index.ts</files>
  <action>
Update `src/index.ts` to:

1. Import `createExecutor` from `./execution/executor.ts`
2. Import `createReviewHandler` from `./handlers/review.ts`
3. After the event router is created and before the Hono app is created, instantiate the executor and register the review handler:

```typescript
import { createExecutor } from "./execution/executor.ts";
import { createReviewHandler } from "./handlers/review.ts";

// ... existing code ...

// Execution engine
const executor = createExecutor({ githubApp, logger });

// Register event handlers
createReviewHandler({
  eventRouter,
  jobQueue,
  workspaceManager,
  githubApp,
  executor,
  logger,
});
```

4. Remove the placeholder comment about "Phase 3+ plans will register handlers" since handlers are now registered.

Keep the existing code structure intact. The new code goes between the `eventRouter` creation and the `new Hono()` line. Do NOT modify any existing route mounting or error handling.
  </action>
  <verify>Run `bun build src/index.ts --no-bundle` to verify the full server compiles. Check that imports resolve correctly.</verify>
  <done>
- Server creates executor instance at startup
- Review handler is registered with all required dependencies
- Pull request opened and ready_for_review events are now handled
- No placeholder comments remain about future handler registration
- Server still starts and compiles cleanly
  </done>
</task>

</tasks>

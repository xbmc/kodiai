<objective>
Turn off the old @claude GitHub Actions workflows and validate Kodiai provides at least equivalent developer experience.

Purpose: Eliminate sandbox-posting failures and consolidate to a single system.
Output: Old workflows removed and smoke-tested parity.

  <what-built>xbmc/xbmc now uses Kodiai instead of Claude GHA</what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
  1) Open a draft PR and then mark it ready_for_review.
     Expected: Kodiai performs an auto-review.
  2) On any PR, add a top-level PR comment with `@claude <question>`.
     Expected: eyes reaction (best-effort) + a reply comment.
  3) On an inline review thread, add a comment with `@claude <question>`.
     Expected: eyes reaction (best-effort) + inline thread reply.
  4) Remove and re-request review for kodiai (review_requested).
     Expected: exactly one review execution/output batch.
  </how-to-verify>
  <resume-signal>Type "approved" or describe what failed and link the run(s)/PR(s)</resume-signal>

<success_criteria>
- Old workflows are gone
- Kodiai handles opened/ready_for_review/review_requested reliably
- @claude alias works without duplicate responders
</success_criteria>

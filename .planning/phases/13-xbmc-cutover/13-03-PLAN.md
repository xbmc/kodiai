  Include:
  - What triggers exist (opened, ready_for_review, review_requested; mentions @kodiai and @claude)
  - Where to look first (GitHub App deliveries, then app logs by deliveryId)
  - How to tell "skipped on purpose" vs failure
  - Fork PR behavior (base clone + pull/<n>/head)
  - Idempotency markers for review_requested and what replay should look like
  - Minimal reproduction templates maintainers can paste

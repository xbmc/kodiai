<current_state>
Phase 27 execution and UAT are complete. The latest UAT run is closed as pass/pass/pass/pass with no open gaps.

Latest UAT artifacts:
- `.planning/phases/27-context-aware-reviews/27-UAT.md` (status: complete)
- Commit: `bc5e828e24` (`test(27): complete UAT - 4 passed, 0 issues`)

Live verification evidence used during this session:
- PR 38 (`test/phase-27-uat-live-verification`) confirmed review execution succeeds and no new exit-128 failure occurred
- PR 39 (`test/phase-27-risk-signal`) produced auth-focused critical finding, validating risk-signal behavior

Workspace note before resuming: repository is not fully clean due to pre-existing planning/doc changes outside this handoff file.
</current_state>

<completed_work>

- Completed `/gsd-execute-phase 27` Plan 27-04 and recorded SUMMARY (`27-04-SUMMARY.md`)
- Re-ran Phase 27 UAT flow end-to-end against live GitHub PRs
- Verified all four Phase 27 user-observable truths as passing
- Updated and finalized `.planning/phases/27-context-aware-reviews/27-UAT.md`
- Committed UAT completion (`bc5e828e24`)

</completed_work>

<remaining_work>

- Phase 27 itself: no remaining execution or gap-closure work
- Next milestone work: start Phase 28 planning (`/gsd-plan-phase 28`)
- Optional cleanup: reconcile stale planning metadata files that still show Phase 27 as in progress
- Optional branch hygiene: close/merge verification PRs (38/39) per preferred workflow

</remaining_work>

<decisions_made>

- Used live verification as source of truth for UAT (not local-only simulation)
- Accepted APPROVE/no-error behavior on PR 38 as sufficient proof that the exit-128 blocker is cleared
- Used targeted auth + dependency fixture PR (PR 39) to explicitly test risk-signal-driven review focus
- Treated UAT as complete only after all four tests were user-confirmed pass

</decisions_made>

<blockers>
- No functional blockers for product progress
- Non-blocking workspace dirt remains:
  - modified: `.planning/phases/27-context-aware-reviews/27-01-PLAN.md`
  - modified: `.planning/phases/27-context-aware-reviews/27-03-PLAN.md`
  - untracked: `.planning/phases/27-context-aware-reviews/27-VERIFICATION.md`
  - untracked: `.planning/debug/`
</blockers>

<context>
Phase 27 now has both implementation completion and live user-facing validation. The main objective was to ensure context-aware review behavior is real in GitHub execution, not just unit-tested. That is now satisfied:

- path-scoped instructions: exercised in live flow
- profile preset behavior: user-confirmed pass
- deterministic diff risk focus: validated via PR 39 finding
- backward compatibility: user-confirmed pass

The best continuation path is to move directly into Phase 28 (knowledge store + explicit learning) while keeping current verification PR references handy for regression checks.

<next_action>
Start with: `/gsd-plan-phase 28`

Then run: `/gsd-execute-phase 28` after plans are created and verified.

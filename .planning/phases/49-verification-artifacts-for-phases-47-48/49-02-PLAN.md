<objective>
Reconcile milestone audit outputs so v0.8 phase verification coverage reflects the new phase 47/48 verification artifacts and clears unverified-phase blockers.

Purpose: Turn verification artifacts into milestone-level closure evidence and eliminate contradictory audit states.
Output: Updated v0.8 milestone audit files with 7/7 phase coverage and no missing-verification blockers for phases 47/48.

  <name>Task 1: Update canonical v0.8 audit to close phase 47/48 verification blockers</name>
  <files>
    .planning/v0.8-v0.8-MILESTONE-AUDIT.md
  </files>
  <action>
Treat `.planning/v0.8-v0.8-MILESTONE-AUDIT.md` as canonical for 7-phase v0.8 scope and reconcile it in one pass: update frontmatter scores (phase coverage from 5/7 to 7/7), remove gaps entries that claim phase 47/48 verification artifacts are missing, and update Phase Verification Coverage table rows for phases 47 and 48 to Present/PASSED with direct file references.

Keep unrelated open items truthful (for example ancillary publish-path sanitization debt) and do not inflate status beyond evidence. Ensure verdict text and routing sections align with updated blocker state.
  </action>
  <verify>
In `.planning/v0.8-v0.8-MILESTONE-AUDIT.md`, frontmatter shows `phases: 7/7` and no `gaps.requirements` entry claims missing phase 47/48 verification files.
  </verify>
  <done>
Canonical audit reflects complete phase verification coverage for v0.8 milestone scope with no unverified phase blockers.
  </done>

  <name>Task 2: Synchronize secondary audit file to avoid coverage drift</name>
  <files>
    .planning/v0.8-MILESTONE-AUDIT.md
  </files>
  <action>
Update `.planning/v0.8-MILESTONE-AUDIT.md` so it no longer contradicts canonical v0.8 phase coverage state. At minimum, ensure it references the same verified phase coverage outcome for phases 47 and 48 (or clearly marks itself as non-canonical while pointing to the canonical audit file).

Preserve consistent status/routing language across both files and avoid partial edits that leave score tables, gap lists, and narrative verdict mismatched.
  </action>
  <verify>
Both audit files agree that phase 47 and phase 48 verification artifacts are present/passed, and neither file reports unverified-phase blockers for those phases.
  </verify>
  <done>
Milestone audit artifacts are internally consistent, preventing future planning/audit confusion from dual-file divergence.
  </done>

1. `grep -n "phases:" .planning/v0.8-v0.8-MILESTONE-AUDIT.md` shows `7/7` in frontmatter score block.
2. `grep -n "Phase 47 is unverified\|Phase 48 is unverified" .planning/v0.8-v0.8-MILESTONE-AUDIT.md .planning/v0.8-MILESTONE-AUDIT.md` returns no matches.
3. Both audit files include explicit Present/PASSED coverage rows for phase 47 and phase 48 verification artifacts.
4. Remaining degraded-flow/tech-debt notes stay evidence-aligned and not falsely closed.

<success_criteria>
- Milestone phase coverage is reconciled from 5/7 to 7/7.
- No unverified-phase blockers remain for phases 47 and 48.
- Dual audit files no longer disagree on v0.8 phase verification state.

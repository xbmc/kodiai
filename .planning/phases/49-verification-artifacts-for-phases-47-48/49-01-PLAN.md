<objective>
Create the missing phase-level verification artifacts for phases 47 and 48 using existing v0.8 verification conventions.

Purpose: Remove the remaining phase-artifact blockers by converting completed phase outcomes into auditable verification reports.
Output: Two new `*-VERIFICATION.md` files for phase 47 and phase 48 with concrete code/test/document evidence.

  <name>Task 1: Author phase 47 verification artifact from backfill summaries and milestone evidence</name>
  <files>
    .planning/phases/47-v0-8-verification-backfill/47-v0-8-verification-backfill-VERIFICATION.md
  </files>
  <action>
Create a full phase verification report for phase 47 using the same structure/section order used in phase 44 and phase 46 verification artifacts: frontmatter, Goal Achievement (Observable Truths, Required Artifacts, Key Link Verification), Requirements Coverage, Anti-Patterns Found, Human Verification Required, and Gaps Summary.

Use phase-47 scope accurately: this is verification backfill/audit reconciliation work, not feature delivery. Evidence must cite concrete file paths and line references from phase 42/43/45/46 verification artifacts and `.planning/v0.8-MILESTONE-AUDIT.md` updates recorded by 47-01/47-02 summaries. Keep requirement treatment truthful (no invented IDs); if requirement ownership is indirect for this phase, state that explicitly per existing repo convention.
  </action>
  <verify>
`ls .planning/phases/47-v0-8-verification-backfill/*-VERIFICATION.md` returns the new file, and the document includes all required sections plus auditable evidence references to phase 47 outputs.
  </verify>
  <done>
Phase 47 has a passable verification artifact that can be consumed by milestone audit without ambiguity.

  </files>
  <action>
Create the phase 48 verification report using the same canonical verification format and evidence depth as phase 46. Verify the three roadmap outcomes: local prompt-context fail-open catch, handler-level fail-open continuation, and regression coverage for lookup-throw degraded path.

Evidence must cite the shipped code/tests summarized in 48-01 and 48-02 (`src/execution/mention-context.ts`, `src/execution/mention-context.test.ts`, `src/handlers/mention.ts`, `src/handlers/mention.test.ts`) and include targeted test command outcomes that prove degraded path resilience. Do not broaden scope beyond phase 48’s CONV-02/CONV-03 hardening objective.
  </action>
  <verify>
`ls .planning/phases/48-conversational-fail-open-hardening/*-VERIFICATION.md` returns the new file; report status is passable with explicit evidence for fail-open behavior and regression coverage.
  </verify>
  <done>
Phase 48 has a passable verification artifact proving fail-open hardening behavior with concrete implementation and test evidence.

1. Both files exist: `47-v0-8-verification-backfill-VERIFICATION.md` and `48-conversational-fail-open-hardening-VERIFICATION.md`.
2. Both reports include the standard verification sections used by prior v0.8 verification artifacts.
3. Each report provides concrete file/test evidence and does not claim out-of-scope behavior.
4. Both reports are audit-ready inputs for milestone phase coverage reconciliation.

<success_criteria>
- `.planning/phases/47-v0-8-verification-backfill/` contains a passable `47-*-VERIFICATION.md`.
- `.planning/phases/48-conversational-fail-open-hardening/` contains a passable `48-*-VERIFICATION.md`.
- Verification artifact quality is consistent with existing phase 42-46 conventions.

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/49-verification-artifacts-for-phases-47-48/49-01-SUMMARY.md`

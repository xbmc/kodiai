# Milestone v0.19 Audit Report

**Milestone:** v0.19 Intelligent Retrieval Enhancements
**Audited:** 2026-02-25
**Status:** GAPS FOUND
**Score:** 5/23 requirements satisfied (21.7%)

## Phase Completion

| Phase | Name | Plans | Status |
|-------|------|-------|--------|
| 93 | Language-Aware Retrieval Boosting | 4/4 | Complete — VERIFICATION passed (13/13) |
| 94 | [depends] PR Deep Review | 0/? | Not started — no directory |
| 95 | CI Failure Recognition | 0/? | Not started — no directory |
| 96 | Code Snippet Embedding | 0/? | Not started — no directory |

**Phases complete:** 1/4

## Requirements Coverage (3-Source Cross-Reference)

### Satisfied Requirements (5/23)

| REQ-ID | VERIFICATION | SUMMARY | REQUIREMENTS.md | Final Status |
|--------|-------------|---------|-----------------|--------------|
| LANG-01 | passed | 01, 04 | [x] Complete | satisfied |
| LANG-02 | passed | 01 | [x] Complete | satisfied |
| LANG-03 | passed | 03, 04 | [x] Complete | satisfied |
| LANG-04 | passed | 03 | [x] Complete | satisfied |
| LANG-05 | passed | 02, 04 | [x] Complete | satisfied |

### Unsatisfied Requirements (18/23) — Orphaned

All 18 requirements below are assigned to phases that were never started. No code, plans, or directories exist.

**Phase 94 — [depends] PR Deep Review (8 requirements):**

| REQ-ID | Description | Status |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| DEPS-01 | Detect [depends] prefix and dependency-bump patterns in PR titles | orphaned |
| DEPS-02 | Detection mutually exclusive with Dependabot/Renovate pipeline | orphaned |
| DEPS-03 | Fetch upstream changelog / release notes for new version | orphaned |
| DEPS-04 | Analyze breaking changes, deprecations, new APIs between versions | orphaned |
| DEPS-05 | Assess impact on Kodi codebase — which files consume dependency | orphaned |
| DEPS-06 | Verify hash/URL changes, check removed/added patches | orphaned |
| DEPS-07 | Check for new transitive dependencies or version conflicts | orphaned |
| DEPS-08 | Surface structured review comment with version diff summary | orphaned |

**Phase 95 — CI Failure Recognition (5 requirements):**

| REQ-ID | Description | Status |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| CIFR-01 | Fetch CI check results for PR head SHA using Checks API | orphaned |
| CIFR-02 | Compare CI results against base branch SHA | orphaned |
| CIFR-03 | Post annotation identifying unrelated failures with reasoning | orphaned |
| CIFR-04 | Do not block approval based on unrelated CI failures | orphaned |
| CIFR-05 | Track historically flaky workflows as unrelatedness signal | orphaned |

**Phase 96 — Code Snippet Embedding (5 requirements):**

| REQ-ID | Description | Status |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| SNIP-01 | PR diff hunks chunked at hunk level for embedding | orphaned |
| SNIP-02 | Hunk embeddings stored in code_snippets table | orphaned |
| SNIP-03 | Content-hash caching prevents re-embedding identical hunks | orphaned |
| SNIP-04 | Hunk embeddings integrated into cross-corpus retrieval | orphaned |
| SNIP-05 | Embedding cost bounded — configurable per-PR hunk cap | orphaned |

## Integration Check

**Phase 93 internal wiring:** 12/12 exports properly consumed, 3/3 E2E flows verified, 0 broken connections.

No cross-phase integration issues within completed work. Phases 94-96 have zero implementation, so no cross-phase wiring exists or is broken.

## Tech Debt

**Phase 93 (minor, cosmetic only):**
- `review.ts` passes Title Case `prLanguages` (e.g., "TypeScript") while `mention.ts` normalizes to lowercase at construction time. Both produce correct results — consumers normalize independently — but the patterns are inconsistent.

## Summary

v0.19 shipped Phase 93 (Language-Aware Retrieval Boosting) completely and with high quality — 13/13 truths verified, all 5 LANG requirements satisfied, 137 tests passing, zero anti-patterns.

However, 3 of 4 milestone phases (94, 95, 96) were never started, leaving 18 of 23 requirements entirely unimplemented. These are not partial implementations or gaps — they are features that were scoped for v0.19 but work never began.

**Options:**
1. **Rescope v0.19** to just Phase 93 (language-aware retrieval) and defer Phases 94-96 to v0.20
2. **Plan and execute** Phases 94-96 before completing the milestone
3. **Force-close** v0.19 with known gaps recorded (similar to v0.13 precedent)

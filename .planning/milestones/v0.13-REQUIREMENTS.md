# Requirements Archive: v0.13 Reliability Follow-Through

**Archived:** 2026-02-18
**Closure mode:** Forced complete with accepted debt

---

## Requirement Outcomes

### Observability

- [x] **OPS-04**: Operator can verify Search cache hit-rate telemetry from a live-triggered run where cache hit and miss outcomes are both exercised.
  - **Outcome:** Partially delivered; verification tooling and preflight gates shipped, but final live OPS evidence still blocked (`OPS75-CACHE-01`, `OPS75-CACHE-02`).
- [x] **OPS-05**: Operator can verify rate-limit telemetry emits exactly once per degraded execution and does not block review completion when telemetry writes fail.
  - **Outcome:** Partially delivered; fail-open and exactly-once checks shipped, but final degraded-row closure evidence remains blocked (`OPS75-ONCE-01`).

### Retrieval Reliability

- [x] **RET-06**: User receives deterministic partial-analysis disclosure when Search enrichment degrades under API limits.
  - **Outcome:** Validated in Phase 73 and remains enforced.
- [x] **RET-07**: User receives bounded retrieval evidence in degraded paths without prompt overflow or malformed context sections.
  - **Outcome:** Validated in Phase 73 and remains enforced.

### Regression Safety

- [x] **REG-01**: Maintainer can run automated regression coverage that validates combined degraded + retrieval behavior in one scenario.
  - **Outcome:** Validated in Phase 74 release-gate path.
- [x] **REG-02**: Maintainer can run a deterministic verification path that proves new reliability checks pass before release.
  - **Outcome:** Partially delivered; deterministic gate exists, but success-path status contract parity is deferred to post-v0.13 follow-up.

## Traceability (Final at Archive Time)

| Requirement | Primary Phase | Final Status |
|-------------|---------------|--------------|
| OPS-04 | 72 + 75 | Partial (tooling complete, live closure evidence pending) |
| OPS-05 | 72 + 75 | Partial (tooling complete, live closure evidence pending) |
| RET-06 | 73 | Validated |
| RET-07 | 73 | Validated |
| REG-01 | 74 | Validated |
| REG-02 | 74 + 76 | Partial (success-path parity deferred) |

---

## Deferred to Next Milestone

- Final OPS75 live PASS bundle for cache/degraded check families.
- Success-path machine-checkable status contract parity between issue write producer and regression gate consumer.

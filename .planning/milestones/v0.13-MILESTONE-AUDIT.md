# Milestone Audit: v0.13 Reliability Follow-Through

## Definition of Done Check

Milestone goal from roadmap: convert reliability follow-through into verifiable operator outcomes for telemetry confidence, deterministic degraded disclosure, and release-gating regression checks.

Result: **Not fully achieved**. Core code paths are implemented and mostly verified, but milestone-level closure is blocked by unresolved live OPS verification and one cross-phase success-path contract mismatch.

## Phase Verification Rollup

| Phase | Verification Status | Requirements | Milestone Impact |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 72 Telemetry Follow-Through | `human_needed` | OPS-04, OPS-05 | Blocking for milestone DoD because live operator evidence is still pending |
| 73 Degraded Retrieval Contract | `passed` | RET-06, RET-07 | Satisfied |
| 74 Reliability Regression Gate | `passed` | REG-01, REG-02 | Satisfied (with integration caveat below) |

## Requirements Coverage

| Requirement | Owning Phase | Coverage | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| OPS-04 | 72 | **Partial** | `72-VERIFICATION.md` marks live cache hit/miss verification as human-required |
| OPS-05 | 72 | **Partial** | `72-VERIFICATION.md` marks live exactly-once/non-blocking degraded validation as human-required |
| RET-06 | 73 | **Satisfied** | `73-VERIFICATION.md` passed with deterministic disclosure enforcement |
| RET-07 | 73 | **Satisfied** | `73-VERIFICATION.md` passed with bounded retrieval + markdown-safe fallback |
| REG-01 | 74 | **Satisfied** | `74-VERIFICATION.md` passed with combined degraded + retrieval scenario checks |
| REG-02 | 74 | **Satisfied** | `74-VERIFICATION.md` passed with deterministic gate path and CAP/REL/RET checks |

## Cross-Phase Integration (gsd-integration-checker)

Integration checker result: **`gaps_found` (7/8 links verified)**.

Validated wiring highlights:
- Phase 72 telemetry exactly-once identity and fail-open semantics are wired end-to-end (`review.ts` -> `store.ts` -> DB uniqueness).
- Phase 73 consumes degraded signal from Phase 72 and enforces shared exact disclosure sentence in publish flow.
- Phase 73 retrieval bounds and markdown-safe fallback are wired for both review and mention surfaces.
- Phase 74 failure contract (`pr_creation_failed`, `failed_step`, retry-once behavior) is implemented and test-backed.
- `verify:phase74` gate command is wired and checks CAP/REL/RET matrices.

Blocking integration gap:
- **Success-path status contract mismatch:**
  - Producer (`src/handlers/mention.ts`) success output posts `Opened PR: <url>` but no machine-checkable `status: success`.
  - Consumer/gate contract and runbook expect machine-checkable status semantics.
  - Result: failure-path contract is deterministic, but success-path contract is not equivalently machine-checkable in the same E2E shape.

## End-to-End Flow Status

| Flow | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Degraded review telemetry reliability | Pass | Exactly-once + fail-open wiring and tests are in place |
| Degraded retrieval rendering safety (review + mention) | Pass | Bounded rendering and markdown-safe fallback verified |
| Issue write failure reliability contract | Pass | Retry-once and explicit `pr_creation_failed` diagnostics verified |
| Regression gate producer/consumer contract parity | Gap | Success-path status marker mismatch weakens machine-checkable E2E consistency |

## Aggregated Tech Debt / Deferred Risks

- Phase 72 still depends on live operator evidence execution to close OPS requirements.
- Phase 73 verification passed but retains an explicit demurral for missing live degraded repro evidence.
- Phase 74 gate relies on external scenario JSON input, which can drift from freshest live artifacts.
- Positive-path machine-checkable success status is not currently locked by regression tests.

## Milestone Verdict

**Status: `gaps_found`**

Critical blockers to milestone completion:
1. Close OPS-04/OPS-05 by completing and recording the required live Phase 72 verification evidence.
2. Resolve cross-phase success-path status contract mismatch between issue write producer and Phase 74 gate consumer expectations.

Until these are addressed, v0.13 does not fully satisfy its milestone definition of done despite strong code-level progress.

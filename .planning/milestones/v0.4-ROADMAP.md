# Milestone v0.4: Intelligent Review System

**Status:** ✅ SHIPPED 2026-02-12
**Phases:** 26-29
**Total Plans:** 17

## Overview

v0.4 focused on improving review quality and operator control through configurable strictness, deterministic context analysis, explicit suppression/confidence controls, and feedback capture for future learning.

## Phases

### Phase 26: Review Mode & Severity Control

**Goal:** Users can control review strictness and receive structured, noise-reduced feedback.
**Depends on:** Phase 25
**Plans:** 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 26-01-PLAN.md — Config schema extension (review mode, severity, focus areas, comment cap)
- [x] 26-02-PLAN.md — Prompt enrichment with mode-aware instructions and handler wiring

### Phase 27: Context-Aware Reviews

**Goal:** Reviews use path-scoped instructions, profile presets, and deterministic diff analysis for targeted findings.
**Depends on:** Phase 26
**Plans:** 4 plans

Plans:
- [x] 27-01-PLAN.md — Config schema extension and deterministic diff analysis module
- [x] 27-02-PLAN.md — Prompt enrichment with path matching and diff context
- [x] 27-03-PLAN.md — Resilient shallow-clone/no-merge-base diff collection
- [x] 27-04-PLAN.md — Elapsed-time budget guardrails and graceful truncation signaling

### Phase 28: Knowledge Store & Explicit Learning

**Goal:** Persist review knowledge per repo and support explicit suppressions/confidence thresholds.
**Depends on:** Phase 27
**Plans:** 9 plans

Plans:
- [x] 28-01-PLAN.md — Knowledge store schema and factory function
- [x] 28-02-PLAN.md — Suppression config schema and confidence scoring engine
- [x] 28-03-PLAN.md — Prompt/runtime wiring for suppression, confidence, and metrics
- [x] 28-04-PLAN.md — CLI stats/trends reporting scripts
- [x] 28-05-PLAN.md — Canonical KNOWLEDGE_DB_PATH contract
- [x] 28-06-PLAN.md — Mode-agnostic Review Details metrics contract
- [x] 28-07-PLAN.md — Runtime finding extraction, filtering, persistence wiring
- [x] 28-08-PLAN.md — Inline suppression/minConfidence enforcement and global-sharing opt-in
- [x] 28-09-PLAN.md — Review Details publication reliability decoupled from jitter

### Phase 29: Feedback Capture

**Goal:** Capture thumbs-up/down feedback and link it to findings for future learning improvements.
**Depends on:** Phase 28
**Plans:** 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 29-01-PLAN.md — Feedback schema and deterministic finding-comment linkage
- [x] 29-02-PLAN.md — Idempotent thumbs reaction sync capture and runtime wiring

## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**
- Review quality controls remain primarily prompt-driven, with deterministic pre-analysis for consistency.
- Knowledge persistence remains non-fatal to core review path to preserve reliability.
- Feedback capture uses supported PR-related webhook traffic for robust sync in place of unsupported direct reaction events.

**Issues Resolved:**
- Added deterministic diff context and path-specific instruction wiring across the review pipeline.
- Introduced durable repo-scoped knowledge persistence and confidence/suppression filtering contracts.
- Implemented idempotent reaction feedback persistence linked to concrete review findings.

**Issues Deferred:**
- None as critical blockers at milestone close.

**Technical Debt Incurred:**
- Reaction feedback capture can be delayed until a supported webhook event triggers sync.
- Minor documentation state drift required post-audit cleanup during milestone completion.

# Milestone v0.13: Reliability Follow-Through

**Status:** FORCED CLOSED 2026-02-18
**Phases:** 72-76
**Total Plans:** 12 planned / 11 summarized

## Overview

v0.13 focused on reliability follow-through from v0.12: validating live telemetry behavior, enforcing degraded retrieval disclosure contracts, and adding deterministic release-gate verification.

Milestone closure was forced with accepted technical debt. Phase 75 remains blocked on live OPS evidence checks and Phase 76 was not yet planned/executed at time of archival.

## Phases

### Phase 72: Telemetry Follow-Through

**Goal**: Operators can verify live Search cache and rate-limit telemetry behavior from real degraded executions without risking review completion.
**Depends on**: Phase 71
**Plans**: 2/2 completed

Plans:

- [x] 72-01-PLAN.md - Exactly-once telemetry identity and fail-open degraded emission semantics
- [x] 72-02-PLAN.md - Deterministic live verification harness with DB assertions and operator artifacts

### Phase 73: Degraded Retrieval Contract

**Goal**: Users receive deterministic degraded-analysis disclosure and bounded retrieval evidence when Search enrichment is rate-limited.
**Depends on**: Phase 72
**Plans**: 2/2 completed

Plans:

- [x] 73-01-PLAN.md - Exact-sentence degraded-analysis disclosure enforcement
- [x] 73-02-PLAN.md - Bounded, well-formed retrieval evidence rendering for review and mention lanes

### Phase 74: Reliability Regression Gate

**Goal**: Maintainers can run deterministic reliability verification that blocks releases when degraded + retrieval behavior regresses.
**Depends on**: Phase 73
**Plans**: 2/2 completed

Plans:

- [x] 74-01-PLAN.md - Retry-once failure semantics and actionable diagnostics for issue write-mode PR publish flows
- [x] 74-02-PLAN.md - Deterministic Phase 74 release gate CLI with Azure capability preflight and runbook

### Phase 75: Live OPS Verification Closure

**Goal**: Close OPS-04 and OPS-05 with reproducible live-run evidence for cache telemetry correctness, exactly-once degraded telemetry emission, and fail-open completion behavior.
**Depends on**: Phase 74
**Plans**: 6 planned / 5 summarized

Plans:

- [x] 75-01-PLAN.md - Telemetry write-failure injection controls and fail-open regression proofs
- [x] 75-02-PLAN.md - Live OPS closure verification CLI, check-ID matrix, and operator procedure
- [x] 75-03-PLAN.md - Author-cache persistence noise fix and OPS75 preflight evidence contract
- [x] 75-04-PLAN.md - Passing mention-lane + degraded-row live evidence bundle capture
- [x] 75-05-PLAN.md - Hard same-run identity capture gates for cache/degraded readiness
- [ ] 75-06-PLAN.md - Single-run OPS75 PASS evidence and closure-status publication (blocked)

### Phase 76: Success-Path Status Contract Parity

**Goal**: Restore producer/consumer contract parity by making issue write success output machine-checkable and enforcing that contract in regression gates.
**Depends on**: Phase 75
**Plans**: 0 planned / 0 summarized

Plans:

- [ ] 76-01-PLAN.md - [Not planned at force close]

## Milestone Summary

**Key outcomes:**

- Deterministic OPS telemetry and degraded-path verification infrastructure is in place.
- Degraded retrieval disclosure and bounded evidence contracts are enforced in runtime and tests.
- Release-gate CLI and machine-checkable check-ID diagnostics were added.

**Accepted gaps at force close:**

- OPS75 live evidence remains blocked by `OPS75-CACHE-01`, `OPS75-CACHE-02`, and `OPS75-ONCE-01` in latest run.
- Success-path status contract parity work (Phase 76) remains unimplemented.

**Deferred follow-up:**

- Resume with a new milestone to close remaining OPS75 live evidence and success-path contract parity.

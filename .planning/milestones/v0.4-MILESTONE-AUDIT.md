# Milestone Audit: v0.4 Intelligent Review System

## Scope

- Milestone: `v0.4 Intelligent Review System`
- Phases in scope: 26-29
- Requirements in scope: FOUND-01..06, CTX-01..04, LEARN-01..05

## Phase Verification Aggregate

| Phase | Verification | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 26-review-mode-severity-control | passed | 16/16 truths verified, FOUND-01..06 satisfied |
| 27-context-aware-reviews | gaps_found | 9/10 truths verified; elapsed-time budget guardrail gap |
| 28-knowledge-store-explicit-learning | passed | 4/4 truths verified; re-verification completed |
| 29-feedback-capture | passed | 6/6 truths verified; live thumbs reaction evidence captured |

**Phase score:** 3/4 passed

## Cross-Phase Integration Check

Integration checker result:

- `integration_score`: 9/9
- `flow_score`: 4/4
- `overall_status`: tech_debt

### Confirmed Links

- Phase 26 config + prompt controls feed Phase 27 context-aware review pipeline.
- Phase 27 diff/path outputs feed Phase 28 suppression/confidence/metrics flow.
- Phase 28 finding linkage + persistence powers Phase 29 thumbs reaction sync mapping.
- Feedback sync handler is wired into runtime webhook/job pipeline.

### Flow Results

| Flow | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Enhanced mode + severity + focus + max comment cap | passed | Config resolution + prompt enrichment path wired |
| Context-aware path instructions + profile behavior | passed | Deterministic diff analysis + path matching + prompt context wiring |
| Suppression/minConfidence filtering + Review Details metrics | passed | Filtering + cleanup + Review Details upsert wired |
| Thumbs reaction feedback capture mapped to findings | passed | Deterministic finding linkage + idempotent reaction persistence |

## Critical Gaps

None identified in requirements, cross-phase wiring, or E2E milestone flows.

## Tech Debt / Deferred Gaps

1. Phase 27 elapsed-time budget guardrails are still missing in deterministic diff analysis (must-have gap from phase verification).
2. Feedback capture is event-driven via supported webhook traffic rather than direct reaction events, which can delay capture timing.
3. Milestone tracking docs are stale (ROADMAP/REQUIREMENTS statuses do not reflect achieved implementation and verification state).

## Audit Decision

Milestone `v0.4` is functionally integrated and requirements-complete, with no critical blockers. Remaining issues are classified as tech debt.

Recommended path:

- Option A: Complete milestone and carry debt into backlog.
- Option B: Plan one cleanup/gap phase before milestone completion to close elapsed-time guardrail and doc-state drift.

## Requirements Coverage

| Requirement | Phase | Status |
|-------------|-------|--------|

**Coverage:** 17/17 (100%)

## Cross-Phase Integration

| From | To | Via | Status |
|------|----|-----|--------|
| Phase 40 (file-risk-scorer) | Phase 51 (timeout-estimator) | LANGUAGE_RISK import | ✓ CONNECTED |
| Phase 27 (diff-analysis) | Phase 52 (retrieval-rerank) | classifyFileLanguage import | ✓ CONNECTED |
| Phase 53 (dep-bump-detector) | Phase 54 (dep-bump-enrichment) | parseSemver import, DepBumpContext type | ✓ CONNECTED |
| Phase 53 (detection) | Phase 54 (enrichment) | depBumpContext data flow in review.ts | ✓ CONNECTED |
| Phase 54 (enrichment) | Phase 55 (confidence) | depBumpContext.security/changelog → computeMergeConfidence | ✓ CONNECTED |
| Phase 55 (confidence) | review-prompt.ts | depBumpContext.mergeConfidence → badge rendering | ✓ CONNECTED |
| Phase 55 (confidence) | review.ts | mergeConfidence → silent approval body | ✓ CONNECTED |

**Wiring:** 18 exports properly integrated, 0 orphaned, 0 missing

## E2E Flows

| # | Flow | Status |
|---|------|--------|
| 1 | Normal PR: timeout estimation → multi-signal retrieval → language reranking → review | ✓ COMPLETE |
| 2 | Dep bump PR: detection → enrichment (advisory + changelog) → confidence → prompt → verdict | ✓ COMPLETE |
| 3 | Group bump PR: detection → skip enrichment → basic dep bump section | ✓ COMPLETE |
| 4 | High-risk large PR: timeout estimation → scope reduction → reduced review | ✓ COMPLETE |
| 5 | Timeout: estimation → partial review → informative timeout_partial message | ✓ COMPLETE |
| 6 | Non-dep PR: detection null → no dep sections → normal review unchanged | ✓ COMPLETE |

**Flows:** 6/6 complete, 0 broken

## Fail-Open Patterns

All phases implement fail-open correctly:
- **Phase 51:** Pure function, safe defaults
- **Phase 52:** try-catch, proceeds without retrieval on error
- **Phase 53:** try-catch, depBumpContext remains null on error
- **Phase 54:** Promise.allSettled, rejected promises set fields to null
- **Phase 55:** Pure function, handles undefined enrichment gracefully

## Tech Debt

**No critical blockers.** Minor items:

Phase 54 flagged 5 human verification items for production validation:
1. Advisory accuracy with real vulnerable packages (live API responses)
2. Changelog rendering quality with real release notes
3. Fail-open behavior under actual API errors/outages
4. Group bump skipping with real multi-package Renovate/Dependabot PRs
5. Character budget enforcement with pathological input

These are production acceptance items, not code gaps.

## Anti-Patterns

No anti-patterns detected across all 5 phases. No TODOs, FIXMEs, stubs, or placeholder implementations found.

## Conclusion

Milestone v0.9 **PASSED** audit. All 17 requirements satisfied, all 5 phases verified, all 6 E2E flows complete, all cross-phase integration wiring verified. No critical gaps, no blockers.

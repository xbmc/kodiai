# Milestone v0.1 Audit

This audit aggregates phase verifications and cross-phase integration checks to validate milestone v0.1 is shippable.

## Summary

- **Status:** ⚡ tech_debt (no critical blockers; some remaining human verification + hardening opportunities)
- **Requirements coverage:** 33/33 mapped v1 requirements implemented across phases
- **Phase verification:** 10/10 phases have VERIFICATION.md; 3 phases still list human verification items
- **Integration:** Webhook -> router -> queue -> workspace -> executor -> MCP -> GitHub outputs is wired end-to-end

## Phase Verification Status

| Phase | Name | Status |
|------:|------|--------|
| 1 | Webhook Foundation | passed |
| 2 | Job Infrastructure | passed |
| 3 | Execution Engine | human_needed |
| 4 | PR Auto-Review | passed |
| 5 | Mention Handling | human_needed |
| 6 | Content Safety | passed |
| 7 | Operational Resilience | passed |
| 8 | Deployment | human_needed |
| 9 | Review UX Improvements | passed |
| 10 | Review Request Reliability | passed |

## Cross-Phase Integration + E2E Flows

**Flow 1: webhook ingress -> review/mention handler -> job queue -> workspace -> executor -> MCP -> GitHub outputs**
- Verified wiring exists from `/webhooks/github` through router dispatch, job queue lifecycle, workspace clone/cleanup, and executor/MCP publication.

**Flow 2: mention surfaces -> tracking comment -> response update**
- Handler + prompt wiring exists; final step depends on model calling `update_comment` reliably (human verification recommended).

**Flow 3: review_requested -> exactly-once output semantics**
- Deterministic `reviewOutputKey` is computed per delivery.
- Preflight checks block replays once marker is present in PR review comments, issue comments, or PR review bodies.
- Output marker stamping now covers:
  - inline review comments
  - summary issue comment publication
  - silent APPROVE reviews for clean PRs

## Notes / Observability

- GitHub delivery forensics via `gh api repos/*/*/hooks/*/deliveries` requires `admin:repo_hook` scope; this is an operator convenience, not a code blocker.

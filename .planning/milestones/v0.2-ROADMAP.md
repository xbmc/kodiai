# Milestone v0.2: Mention-Driven Changes

**Status:** DRAFT
**Created:** 2026-02-10

v0.2 extends Kodiai from "review + answer" into "safe, auditable changes" initiated by a mention.

## Overview

This roadmap is deliberately staged so that safety and observability exist before write automation becomes broadly available.

## Proposed Phases

- **Phase 14: Write-Mode Foundations**
  - Add a "change request" intent model for mentions (explicit write request vs question).
  - Add execution artifacts: branch naming, trace IDs, and output markers for write operations.
  - Add a publish surface for "proposed plan" vs "applied changes".

- **Phase 15: Branch + Commit + PR Pipeline**
  - Create branch and commit changes in a workspace.
  - Push branch and open/update PR.
  - Ensure fork-safe behavior and permissions-aware fallbacks.

- **Phase 16: Guardrails + Policy**
  - Path allow/deny rules.
  - Secret detection blocks.
  - Rate limits/concurrency enforcement for writes.

- **Phase 17: Durability + Locking**
  - Strengthen locking/idempotency for write operations.
  - Ensure redelivery and retries do not create duplicate commits/PRs.

- **Phase 18: Ops + Evidence UX**
  - Operator evidence bundle (deliveryId -> links).
  - Runbook updates for write-mode incidents.

## Mapping to Requirements

- Phase 14: MOD-01, SAFE-01, OPS-10
- Phase 15: MOD-02, MOD-03, MOD-04
- Phase 16: MOD-05, SAFE-02, SAFE-03, SAFE-04
- Phase 17: DUR-01, DUR-02, DUR-03, SAFE-05
- Phase 18: OPS-11, OPS-12

## Exit Criteria (Milestone Done)

- One end-to-end demo exists: mention -> proposed plan -> branch/commit -> PR update.
- Write requests are blocked unless explicitly requested.
- Every write operation is traceable by deliveryId + links.

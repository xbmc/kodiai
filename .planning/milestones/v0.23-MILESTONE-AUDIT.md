# v0.23 Interactive Troubleshooting — Milestone Audit

**Audited:** 2026-03-01
**Status:** gaps_found
**Score:** 12/20 requirements satisfied

## Phase Status

| Phase | Name | Status | VERIFICATION.md | Requirements |
|-------|------|--------|-----------------|--------------|
| 110 | Troubleshooting Retrieval Foundation | **NOT STARTED** | Missing | TSHOOT-01, 02, 03 — unsatisfied |
| 111 | Troubleshooting Agent | **NOT STARTED** | Missing | TSHOOT-04, 05, 06, 07, 08 — unsatisfied |
| 112 | Outcome Capture | Passed | 9/9 truths | OUTCOME-01..05, REACT-01 — all satisfied |
| 113 | Threshold Learning | Passed | 10/10 truths | LEARN-01..04 — all satisfied |
| 114 | Reaction Tracking | Passed | 7/7 truths | REACT-02, REACT-03 — all satisfied |

## Requirements Coverage (3-Source Cross-Reference)

### Satisfied Requirements (12/20)

| Requirement | VERIFICATION.md | SUMMARY Frontmatter | REQUIREMENTS.md | Final Status |
|-------------|-----------------|---------------------|-----------------|--------------|
| OUTCOME-01 | passed | missing | [x] | **satisfied** |
| OUTCOME-02 | passed | missing | [x] | **satisfied** |
| OUTCOME-03 | passed | missing | [x] | **satisfied** |
| OUTCOME-04 | passed | missing | [x] | **satisfied** |
| OUTCOME-05 | passed | missing | [x] | **satisfied** |
| REACT-01 | passed | missing | [x] | **satisfied** |
| LEARN-01 | passed | missing | [x] | **satisfied** |
| LEARN-02 | passed | missing | [x] | **satisfied** |
| LEARN-03 | passed | missing | [x] | **satisfied** |
| LEARN-04 | passed | missing | [x] | **satisfied** |
| REACT-02 | passed | listed | [x] | **satisfied** |
| REACT-03 | passed | listed | [x] | **satisfied** |

Note: SUMMARY frontmatter `requirements_completed` was not populated for phases 112-01, 112-02, 113-01, 113-02. This is a documentation hygiene gap — the VERIFICATION.md files comprehensively confirm all requirements are met.

### Unsatisfied Requirements (8/20)

| Requirement | Description | Phase | Reason |
|-------------|-------------|-------|--------|
| TSHOOT-01 | State-filtered vector search for resolved issues | Phase 110 | Phase not started |
| TSHOOT-02 | Resolution-focused thread assembly with character budget | Phase 110 | Phase not started |
| TSHOOT-03 | Wiki fallback and transparent "no match" response | Phase 110 | Phase not started |
| TSHOOT-04 | Synthesize troubleshooting guidance from resolved issues | Phase 111 | Phase not started |
| TSHOOT-05 | Cite source resolved issues with provenance | Phase 111 | Phase not started |
| TSHOOT-06 | Keyword-based troubleshooting intent classification | Phase 111 | Phase not started |
| TSHOOT-07 | Config gate triage.troubleshooting.enabled | Phase 111 | Phase not started |
| TSHOOT-08 | Comment-scoped marker dedup by trigger comment ID | Phase 111 | Phase not started |

### Orphaned Requirements

None. All 20 requirements in the traceability table are assigned to phases 110-114.

## Cross-Phase Integration

**Score:** 12/12 requirement integrations wired | 3/3 E2E flows complete

All cross-phase wiring between completed phases (112, 113, 114) is verified:

| From | To | Via | Status |
|------|----|-----|--------|
| issue-closed.ts (Phase 112) | threshold-learner.ts (Phase 113) | `recordObservation` import + call | WIRED |
| issue-opened.ts | threshold-learner.ts (Phase 113) | `getEffectiveThreshold` import + call | WIRED |
| sync-triage-reactions.ts (Phase 114) | threshold-learner.ts (Phase 113) | `recordObservation` import + call | WIRED |
| sync-triage-reactions.ts (Phase 114) | issue_triage_state.comment_github_id (Phase 112) | SELECT WHERE IS NOT NULL | WIRED |
| triage_comment_reactions (Phase 114) | issue_triage_state (Phase 112) | FK triage_id REFERENCES | WIRED |

### E2E Flows

1. **Issue opened → adaptive threshold → triage comment → comment_github_id stored** — Complete
2. **Issue closed → outcome recorded → Bayesian observation → threshold updated** — Complete
3. **Nightly cron → reaction sync → secondary Bayesian observation** — Complete

No broken flows across completed phases.

## Tech Debt

### Phase 114: Reaction Tracking
- `duplicate_count` selected but never consumed in `sync-triage-reactions.ts:150` (dead column)
- `claimIssueTriage` does not reset `comment_github_id` to NULL on re-triage — stale reaction polling edge case
- `listForIssueComment` uses `per_page:100` with no pagination loop — silently under-counts on 100+ reaction comments

### Phases 112-113: Documentation Hygiene
- SUMMARY frontmatter `requirements_completed` not populated for plans 112-01, 112-02, 113-01, 113-02

**Total:** 5 items across 3 phases (0 critical, 3 low, 1 informational, 1 documentation)

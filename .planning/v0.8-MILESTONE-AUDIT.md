## Cross-Phase Integration Check

External integration checker result:
- Integration score: **17/17**
- E2E flow score: **4/4**
- Critical integration blockers: **none**

### Confirmed wired paths

- PR-open flow is wired across keyword parsing -> profile resolution -> prioritization -> author-tier adaptation -> Review Details transparency.
- Reply-mention flow is wired across reply detection -> finding lookup -> thread context -> turn limiting -> outbound handling.
- Override precedence contract is explicit and tested (keyword > manual > auto).
- Phase 50 mention sanitization: `sanitizeOutgoingMentions` applied at all 12 publish points with `botHandles` threaded through `ExecutionContext`.

### Integration warnings (non-critical)

- Parsed `noReview` intent is logged post-parse, while skip behavior is currently enforced by early title regex gate.

## Broken/Degraded Flows

| Flow | Status | Detail |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PR opened review pipeline | PASS | Fully wired across phases 42-45 with transparency output |
| Reply mention conversational pipeline | PASS | Core flow works with thread context + safeguards |
| Reply mention when finding lookup throws | PASS | Fail-open behavior degrades to no finding metadata without routing to handler-level error path |
| Outgoing mention sanitization across all publish paths | PASS | Phase 50: `sanitizeOutgoingMentions` applied at all 12 publish points (5 MCP + 7 review handler) with regression tests |

## Aggregated Tech Debt and Deferred Gaps

| Area | Type | Item |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Phase 42 | Tooling debt | Global `tsc --noEmit` still fails on unrelated files |
| Phase 46 | Tooling debt | Global `tsc --noEmit` still fails on unrelated files |
| Phase 46 | Process/tooling debt | `gsd-tools state` parse failure required manual `STATE.md` update |
| Cross-phase mention publishing | Resolved | Phase 50 applied `sanitizeOutgoingMentions` at all 12 publish points with regression test coverage |
| Conversational mention fail-open | Integration debt | Prompt-level finding lookup throw not locally fail-open |

## Recommended Routing

Audit status is `passed`. All flows are operational and regression-tested. No remaining gaps.

Phase 50 resolved the final gap: `sanitizeOutgoingMentions` is now applied at all 12 outbound GitHub publish points (5 MCP server tools + 7 review handler direct Octokit calls), with `botHandles` threaded from handlers through `ExecutionContext` to all MCP server constructors. Regression tests verify sanitization at all 5 MCP publish paths.

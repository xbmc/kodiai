# Milestone v0.8 Audit Report

## Verdict

Milestone v0.8 is **verification-complete for phases 42-46** and no longer blocked by missing phase verification artifacts.

- Phase-level verification evidence now exists for all five implementation phases.
- Requirement-level traceability is closed for v0.8 scope requirements (KEY/PROF/PRIOR/AUTH/CONV).
- Integration wiring remains strong overall (16/17), with one known degraded flow still deferred to phase 48.

## Milestone Scope

- In-scope phases: 42, 43, 44, 45, 46
- Definition of done source: `.planning/ROADMAP.md`

## Cross-Phase Integration Check

External integration checker result:
- Integration score: **16/17**
- E2E flow score: **3/4**
- Critical integration blockers: **none**

### Confirmed wired paths

- PR-open flow is wired across keyword parsing -> profile resolution -> prioritization -> author-tier adaptation -> Review Details transparency.
- Reply-mention flow is wired across reply detection -> finding lookup -> thread context -> turn limiting -> outbound handling.
- Override precedence contract is explicit and tested (keyword > manual > auto).

### Integration warnings (non-critical)

- Outgoing mention sanitization is strongly wired in handler reply/error/fallback paths, but not guaranteed across every publish-tool output path.
- Parsed `noReview` intent is logged post-parse, while skip behavior is currently enforced by early title regex gate.

## Broken/Degraded Flows

| Flow | Status | Detail |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PR opened review pipeline | PASS | Fully wired across phases 42-45 with transparency output |
| Reply mention conversational pipeline | PASS | Core flow works with thread context + safeguards |
| Override precedence behavior | PASS | Keyword > manual > auto is explicit and regression-tested |
| Mention fail-open on finding lookup error | DEGRADED | Prompt-level lookup throw can route to handler error reply instead of no-context fallback (deferred to phase 48) |

## Aggregated Tech Debt and Deferred Gaps

| Area | Type | Item |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Phase 42 | Tooling debt | Global `tsc --noEmit` still fails on unrelated files |
| Phase 46 | Tooling debt | Global `tsc --noEmit` still fails on unrelated files |
| Phase 46 | Process/tooling debt | `gsd-tools state` parse failure required manual `STATE.md` update |
| Cross-phase mention publishing | Integration debt | Sanitization not guaranteed on every model publish path |
| Conversational mention fail-open | Integration debt | Prompt-level finding lookup throw not locally fail-open |

## Recommended Routing

Audit status is `gaps_found` only because deferred phase 48 hardening work remains for conversational fail-open and cross-path mention sanitization resilience.

Immediate closure work:
1. Phase 48: patch mention prompt-level finding lookup to fail-open to empty finding context.
2. Ensure outgoing mention sanitization is enforced across all publish paths.

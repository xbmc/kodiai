# Milestone v0.8 Audit Report

## Verdict

Milestone v0.8 is **not ready for DoD sign-off yet**.

- Requirements are fully satisfied (31/31) with phase-verified evidence for KEY/PROF/PRIOR/AUTH/CONV.
- Phase verification artifacts are present and passed for all in-scope phases (42-48), clearing phase-level audit blockers.
- Remaining milestone gap is the degraded flow: outgoing mention sanitization is not guaranteed across every publish path.

## Milestone Scope

- Milestone: v0.8 Conversational Intelligence
- In-scope phases: 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48
- Definition of done source: `.planning/ROADMAP.md`
- Requirement source: `.planning/REQUIREMENTS.md`

## Requirements Coverage

Status policy used for this audit:
- `satisfied`: owning phase in `.planning/REQUIREMENTS.md` has a present passed verification report
- `unsatisfied`: owning phase unverified or blocked

## Cross-Phase Integration Check

External integration checker result:
- Integration score: **16/17**
- E2E flow score: **3/4**
- Critical integration blockers: **none**

### Confirmed wired paths

- Phase 42 -> 43: `parsePRIntent` overrides are consumed by `resolveReviewProfile` in review handler wiring.
- Phase 43 -> 44: resolved profile comment caps feed `prioritizeFindings` with configured weights.
- Phase 45 wiring is active: author tier resolution feeds prompt adaptation and review output.
- Review -> mention bridge is active: persisted finding `commentId` links to mention lookup context.
- Phase 48 fail-open hardening is active in both mention context builder and mention handler hydration.

### Integration warnings (non-critical)

- Outgoing mention sanitization is strong on primary conversational reply/error/fallback paths, but not uniformly wrapped for all ancillary publish paths.

## Broken/Degraded Flows

| Flow | Status | Detail |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PR opened review pipeline | PASS | Keyword parsing -> profile -> prioritization -> author adaptation wiring is intact |
| Reply mention conversational pipeline | PASS | Thread context and finding-aware reply behavior are wired and regression-tested |
| Reply mention when finding lookup throws | PASS | Fail-open behavior now degrades to no finding metadata without routing to handler-level error path |
| Outgoing mention sanitization across all publish paths | DEGRADED | Ancillary publish paths still need uniform sanitization helper coverage |

## Aggregated Tech Debt and Deferred Gaps

| Area | Type | Item |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Phase 42 | Integration style debt | No-review skip remains enforced by early title regex gate rather than parser-output gate |
| Phase 44 | Test-code cleanliness debt | Placeholder fixtures/nullable helper patterns exist but are non-blocking |
| Phase 45 | Reliability tradeoff | Cache write remains intentionally fail-open and warning-only |
| Cross-phase mention publishing | Integration debt | Centralized sanitized publish wrapper still recommended for full-path guarantee |

## Recommended Routing

Audit status is `gaps_found` because outgoing mention sanitization is not guaranteed across every publish path.

Immediate closure work:
1. Adopt one centralized sanitized publish helper so every outbound mention/comment path is uniformly sanitized.
2. Re-run milestone audit after publish-path sanitization is enforced on ancillary paths.

# Kodiai

## What This Is

Kodiai is an AI-powered GitHub bot that reviews pull requests, triages issues, answers questions via Slack, and runs autonomous coding tasks (write mode). It watches GitHub webhooks, runs Claude via the Anthropic Agent SDK in isolated Azure Container App jobs, and posts structured findings back to GitHub comments and Slack.

## Core Value

Automated, high-signal code review on every PR — findings land in a structured GitHub comment with severity, confidence, suppression, and reviewer context. Everything else extends this.

## Current State

Full review pipeline deployed: webhook ingestion, PR review (full + retry + inline), issue triage, Slack assistant, write-mode agent execution, MCP tooling, knowledge/wiki system, contributor profiling, and multi-model routing. M034 completed Claude Code usage visibility — the Review Details GitHub comment section now shows weekly limit utilization percentage, reset timing, and token counts (in/out/cost) when the agent run emits a rate-limit event. All 34 milestones complete.

## Architecture / Key Patterns

- **Entrypoint:** Hono HTTP server (`src/index.ts`) receiving GitHub webhooks + Slack events
- **Execution:** Azure Container App Jobs dispatch per review; agent writes `result.json` to shared Azure Files mount
- **Agent SDK:** `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk` v0.2.87; agent entrypoint at `src/execution/agent-entrypoint.ts`
- **MCP:** Per-job bearer tokens, stateless HTTP MCP servers; registry in `src/execution/mcp/http-server.ts`
- **Review output:** GitHub comment with `formatReviewDetailsSummary()` in `src/lib/review-utils.ts` posting Review Details `<details>` block (includes usage/token lines when present)
- **Cost tracking:** `src/llm/cost-tracker.ts` + `src/telemetry/` for DB persistence
- **Usage visibility:** `ExecutionResult.usageLimit` captures last `SDKRateLimitEvent` from the agent run; rendered in Review Details via optional `usageLimit` and `tokenUsage` params on `formatReviewDetailsSummary`

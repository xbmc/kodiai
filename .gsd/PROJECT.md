# Kodiai

## What This Is

Kodiai is an AI-powered GitHub bot that reviews pull requests, triages issues, answers questions via Slack, and runs autonomous coding tasks (write mode). It watches GitHub webhooks, runs Claude via the Anthropic Agent SDK in isolated Azure Container App jobs, and posts structured findings back to GitHub comments and Slack.

## Core Value

Automated, high-signal code review on every PR — findings land in a structured GitHub comment with severity, confidence, suppression, and reviewer context. Everything else extends this.

## Current State

Full review pipeline deployed. M034 completed Claude Code usage visibility. M035 is in progress: S01 complete — all non-wiki embedding constants upgraded to voyage-4 (swept 25 hardcoded voyage-code-3 literals from 11 source files) and createRerankProvider with rerank-2.5 model is implemented and unit-tested. S02 (reranker pipeline wiring) is next.

## Architecture / Key Patterns

- **Entrypoint:** Hono HTTP server (`src/index.ts`) receiving GitHub webhooks + Slack events
- **Execution:** Azure Container App Jobs dispatch per review; agent writes `result.json` to shared Azure Files mount
- **Agent SDK:** `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk` v0.2.87; agent entrypoint at `src/execution/agent-entrypoint.ts`
- **MCP:** Per-job bearer tokens, stateless HTTP MCP servers; registry in `src/execution/mcp/http-server.ts`
- **Review output:** GitHub comment with `formatReviewDetailsSummary()` in `src/lib/review-utils.ts` posting Review Details `<details>` block (includes usage/token lines when present)
- **Cost tracking:** `src/llm/cost-tracker.ts` + `src/telemetry/` for DB persistence
- **Usage visibility:** `ExecutionResult.usageLimit` captures last `SDKRateLimitEvent` from the agent run; rendered in Review Details via optional `usageLimit` and `tokenUsage` params on `formatReviewDetailsSummary`
- **Embeddings:** Non-wiki corpora use voyage-4 (`DEFAULT_EMBEDDING_MODEL` in runtime.ts, `NON_WIKI_TARGET_EMBEDDING_MODEL` in embedding-repair.ts). Wiki pages use voyage-context-3. `createRerankProvider` in embeddings.ts provides a rerank-2.5 client with fail-open semantics for post-RRF neural reranking.

## Milestone Sequence

- [x] M001–M033: MVP through Security Hardening (all complete)
- [x] M034: Claude Code Usage Visibility — Surface weekly limit utilization and token usage in Review Details
- [ ] M035: Voyage AI Model Upgrades — voyage-4 + rerank-2.5
  - [x] S01: voyage-4 Embedding Upgrade + Reranker Client
  - [ ] S02: Reranker Pipeline Wiring + Runtime Integration
- [ ] M039: Review Output Hardening — tighten breaking-change keyword parsing, restore truthful Claude usage visibility, and add real regression fixtures
- [ ] M040: Graph-Backed Extensive Review Context — persistent structural graph, blast-radius review selection, bounded graph context, optional validation gate
- [ ] M036: Auto Rule Generation from Feedback — cluster learning memories → propose/auto-activate rules → inject into review prompt

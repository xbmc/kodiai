# Kodiai

## What This Is

Kodiai is an AI-powered GitHub bot that reviews pull requests, triages issues, answers questions via Slack, and runs autonomous coding tasks (write mode). It watches GitHub webhooks, runs Claude via the Anthropic Agent SDK in isolated Azure Container App jobs, and posts structured findings back to GitHub comments and Slack.

## Core Value

Automated, high-signal code review on every PR — findings land in a structured GitHub comment with severity, confidence, suppression, and reviewer context. Everything else extends this.

## Current State

M036 S02 complete. The activation-to-prompt pipeline for generated rules is fully implemented: `applyActivationPolicy` promotes pending rules meeting the signal threshold to active, `getActiveRulesForPrompt` retrieves sanitized active rules fail-openly, and `buildReviewPrompt` now injects a `## Generated Review Rules` section when rules are present. S03 (retirement, notification, and lifecycle proof) is next.

## Architecture / Key Patterns

- **Entrypoint:** Hono HTTP server (`src/index.ts`) receiving GitHub webhooks + Slack events
- **Execution:** Azure Container App Jobs dispatch per review; agent writes `result.json` to shared Azure Files mount
- **Agent SDK:** `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk` v0.2.87; agent entrypoint at `src/execution/agent-entrypoint.ts`
- **MCP:** Per-job bearer tokens, stateless HTTP MCP servers; registry in `src/execution/mcp/http-server.ts`
- **Review output:** GitHub comment with `formatReviewDetailsSummary()` in `src/lib/review-utils.ts` posting Review Details `<details>` block (includes usage/token lines when present)
- **Cost tracking:** `src/llm/cost-tracker.ts` + `src/telemetry/` for DB persistence
- **Usage visibility:** `ExecutionResult.usageLimit` captures last `SDKRateLimitEvent` from the agent run; rendered in Review Details via optional `usageLimit` and `tokenUsage` params on `formatReviewDetailsSummary`
- **Embeddings:** Non-wiki corpora use voyage-4 (`DEFAULT_EMBEDDING_MODEL` in runtime.ts, `NON_WIKI_TARGET_EMBEDDING_MODEL` in embedding-repair.ts). Wiki pages use voyage-context-3. `createRerankProvider` in embeddings.ts provides a rerank-2.5 client with fail-open semantics for post-RRF neural reranking.
- **Generated rules:** `src/knowledge/generated-rule-activation.ts` — activation policy (shouldAutoActivate predicate + applyActivationPolicy orchestrator). `src/knowledge/active-rules.ts` — sanitized retrieval + formatActiveRulesSection formatter. Rules injected into `buildReviewPrompt` before custom instructions via `activeRules?: SanitizedActiveRule[]` context field.
